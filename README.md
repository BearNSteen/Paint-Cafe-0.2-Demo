A visual novel that takes place in a Cafe, eventually extending out to other locations. You can meet characters in the Cafe and they will share their experiences with you.  
It takes place in a fantasy land called T'Lass that was co-created by myself and Erik Stolz. We originally used it for DND 5e sessions, so there are references to some DND gods and classes.
